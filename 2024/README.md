# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to advent :)

# Day 1: 2788/2217

Fun first problem to get warmed up.

# Day 2: 10753/6824

Started a bit late, no stress.

# Day 3: 9934/8077

Started late again, still chill. Regex is a bit annoying - I think it can def be cleaned up with regex + py pattern
matching which I might do as a showcase

# Day 4: 67614/60536

Started during lunch the day after. Had to adjust solution between p1 and 2. I'm happy with my p2 solution since i didn't run into any bugs while implementing it. Still think I could've gone with my original idea with using a set of 3x3 convolutional kernels to scan through the grid, but this will do for today.
